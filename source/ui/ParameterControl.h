        A slider that drags the way this house expects one to.

        Two departures from JUCE's default, both of them things a plugin has to decide
        rather than inherit:

        **The wheel does nothing.** A window with forty-odd controls in it is a window
        somebody scrolls past, and a wheel that changes whatever it happens to be over
        turns that into an edit nobody made and cannot see to undo.

        **Holding the fine modifier drags finely rather than by velocity.** JUCE's
        default is to swap into velocity mode when a modifier is held, which hides the
        pointer and moves the value by how *fast* the mouse is going -- so a slow hand
        does nothing and a twitch jumps a long way. It reads as the control being
        broken. This keeps the drag absolute and simply makes it take six times the
        distance, which is what "fine" is supposed to mean.
