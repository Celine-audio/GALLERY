        The palette, in one place, shared across the house plugins.

        Two rules. Nothing outside this header names a hex value; and the accents are
        named for the job they do rather than for the colour they are, so a change of
        palette does not have to be chased through the call sites.

        The design is two-tone, and that is the thing to hold on to when adding
        anything: the chrome is dark aubergine and the canvas darker still, while the
        panels you reach into are near-white. A new widget has to know which side of
        that line it sits on, because the text colour flips with it.

        Only the dark half is here. A plugin that actually puts a light panel in front
        of you declares its ground and its ink itself -- see PluginThemeRoles.h -- for
        the same reason nothing else here is offered to a window that cannot paint with
        it. The two-tone rule is the house's; the second tone is not always present.

        **Every one of these is a lookup, not a constant.** What they answer is whatever
        the theme in force says -- see ThemePalette.h. Two consequences worth knowing
        before writing a control:

        - Read them **at paint time**. A colour taken once in a constructor and handed to
          `setColour` is a snapshot, and a snapshot does not follow a theme change. Where
          a JUCE widget insists on being told its colours, take them in an override of
          `lookAndFeelChanged()`, which the window calls on every child when the theme
          moves.
        - The shipped values, the editor's labels and the keys a `.celthm` file uses all
          live in ThemeRoles.h. Adding a colour means adding it there; this header is
          where it is given a name and a reason.
